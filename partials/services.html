        <p class="service-info">Jennifer loves the healing nature of her practice which is dedicated exclusively to “family law” or “domestic relations cases” for the individuals, couples and families whom she serves.  Divorces encompass much of her practice, including the negotiation of complex and detailed parenting plans, support structures and property division.  Jennifer also brainstorms with her clients to explore alternatives to divorce, including cases brought as “separate support” matters or situations benefitting from a post-marital or other agreement clarifying rights and responsibilities while people remain legally married.  Her work includes the creation of pre-nuptial agreements for individuals who are entering marriages with significant wealth or who are embarking on second or third chapters with children from prior marriages they wish to protect.  For cases involving children who have unmarried parents or who are living with other family members (like grandparents or guardians), Jennifer helps her clients to craft parenting plans for the best interests of each child and to use financial resources for the greatest common good of each family.  Following the entry of any judgments by the Probate and Family Court, Jennifer also assists her clients with the necessary enforcement or defense of court obligations through Complaints for Contempt, addressing important issues such as access to one’s children or the collection or suspension of payments for alimony, child support, college expenses, or health-related costs.  Often, Jennifer’s representation of her clients is required when one’s life situation changes, prompting the need to review an existing parenting plan or to adjust or terminate established financial obligations through the pursuit of a Complaint for Modification.  She is highly trained in circumstances affected by domestic violence, mental health issues, and substance abuse, notably advocating for clients in the pursuit or defense of Abuse Prevention Orders before both civil and criminal courts.

       <h1 class="title2">Our Rates</h1>
        <p class="service-info">We tailor our professional rates to each case but generally require a retainer at the commencement of our work and usually bill our professional time by the hour.  Our hourly rates are competitive and fair given Jennifer’s level of experience and the demand for her services.  Your retainer is determined based upon the complexity and dynamics of your case, and it is placed into a separate client trust account from which funds are accessed each month after billing.  For some cases, we may offer a flat fee; for others, we may be able to offer a monthly payment plan.  We always are open to alternative billing structures in many circumstances as crafted together with each client.</p>
