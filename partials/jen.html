<p class="team-info">
   Jennifer J. DiGregorio celebrates her twenty-fifth year of practice in 2017, highlighting a career dedicated to guiding individuals, couples and families through the emotional and financial difficulties of domestic relations cases.   She began her professional path as an associate for Atwood & Cherny, a family law boutique in Boston’s Back Bay before becoming a staff attorney then managing attorney of Legal Services for Cape Cod & Islands, Inc., in Hyannis and Plymouth where she specialized in cases involving domestic violence.  Jennifer returned to private practice in 1997, first as a solo practitioner and then as a founding partner of Caparell & DiGregorio, LLP The Family Law Group in Plymouth where she grew her reputation as a caring but fierce advocate for her clients.  She started this firm in 2006 with a focus on providing creative and mindful approaches to one of the most challenging areas of the law as a litigator or as a mediator.  Jennifer is known for her excellence in other roles as well.  Her intervention often is sought out by her colleagues to mediate cases just prior to trial where earlier efforts of counsel and the involvement of the court fail to result in a negotiated settlement.  Jennifer regularly serves as a Conciliator or a Discovery Master where she is chosen by her peers or appointed by local judges to assist in matters involving complex assets or contentious dynamics between counsel and/or the parties.  She accepts appointments both as Guardian ad Litem and Parent Coordinator.  A summa cum graduate of Springfield College in 1989, Jennifer earned her Juris Doctorate from Northeastern University in 1992.<br>
   Jennifer volunteers as Lawyer of The Day and as Conciliator for the Plymouth Probate and Family Court along with the Plymouth County Bar Association.   She is past president of the Plymouth District Bar Association, one of the oldest such associations in the United States.  Additionally, she has been a member of the Massachusetts Bar Association, the Barnstable and Plymouth County Bar Associations, the Massachusetts Council on Family Mediation, and the Massachusetts Collaborative Law Council.  Jennifer has served on educational panels for Massachusetts Continuing Legal Education, the Plymouth District Attorney’s Office, the South Shore Women’s Center and the South Shore Housing Authority.  She lives on the South Shore and Cape Cod with her blended tribe where she loves her coastal communities.
