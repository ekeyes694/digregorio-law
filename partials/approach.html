                Jennifer has extensive experience in situations requiring tools available through litigation, the more traditional path where you and your partner, spouse, or former spouse seek the intervention of the Probate and Family Court to resolve your differences.  She focuses on educating you on the law, on the process, and on the procedures for your best course of action to meet your goals.  She helps you define your own objectives then works with you to pursue these objectives in a comprehensive and effective manner.  Jennifer utilizes the Massachusetts General Laws, the Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure, and cases interpreting these rules and statutes as determined by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial and Appeals Courts to work toward a fully-negotiated resolution on your behalf.  Where necessary, she seeks the input of our local judiciary on an interim basis through temporary orders to shape parenting plans for children and to establish financial stability for families in transition. Jennifer is an artful and powerful advocate in court, presenting your unique history within the framework of the court process. She can be aggressive but always is dignified, ethical and professional in her efforts.  She always builds on each family’s best interests when seeking court guidance on obstacles to common ground.  Jennifer recognizes that court-assisted resolution sometimes may be the best path ultimately to achieving an individually-tailored agreement between the parties.  Of note, local statistics indicate that most cases filed with the Probate and Family Court resolve with a fully or partially negotiated settlement rather than with the emotional and financial costs of extensive litigation.  Jennifer’s creativity and the quality of her work are reflected most in her excellent reputation.

                Jennifer is sought out by many of her colleagues to act as a guardian ad litem on a regular basis; she often is appointed by our local judges to fill this role as well.  Sometimes, you, your partner, spouse or former spouse are unable to agree on issues involving your children, especially in situations where one parent seeks sole legal or physical custody of your children or seeks judicial permission to “remove” or relocate your children outside of Massachusetts.  Upon the written request of either or both parents or upon its own initiative, the Probate and Family Court may appoint Jennifer as a “guardian ad litem” or “next friend” to the court, authorizing her to interview you and your children, to complete home visits, to observe interactions within families, to contact collaterals like child care providers, physicians and under limited circumstances therapists, and to gather data from which she drafts impressions, findings and recommendations in a written report.  Her report and possible later testimony in a court hearing provide your judge with details and information which otherwise may not be available in making his or her final decision about your case.  Jennifer strives to give your children a “voice” in this difficult process while never placing them under the strain of “choosing” between you.   She loves being part of a solution in custody disputes and removal matters wherever possible.

                Jennifer is certified and trained in conciliation, an alternative dispute resolution process which may be mandated by the Probate and Family Court or which may be selected by you and your spouse or partner in lieu of litigation.  Drawing upon her years of experience as a litigator and as a mediator, she examines issues in dispute in your circumstance with fresh eyes, and she works tirelessly to broker compromises where concessions may have eluded you.  Jennifer is able to help you and your attorneys reach common ground with clarity and precision, often drafting clauses for settlement agreements as a neutral to settle matters scheduled for trial.                </p>

             Jennifer is certified as a family law mediator, and her dispute-resolution work as a mediator for couples or families and as a mediation coach for individuals encompasses a large part of her practice.  Mediation is a practical alternative for you if you are separating or divorcing or if you are facing continued challenges with your former partner or spouse.  Helping you develop opportunities for balance and growth, this process allows you to preserve an amicable relationship with one another and to avoid the expense as well as toxicity of litigation.  Jennifer’s sensitivity to the difficult dynamics and struggles presented family law cases fosters a kind and supportive forum for mediation.  Her extensive experience allows her to draft all of the legal documents necessary for couples or families to file uncontested cases with the Probate and Family Court, including detailed financial statements and extensive settlement agreements.  If you are working with another mediator, then Jennifer provides individual assistance to you as your mediation coach, strategizing with you between your mediation sessions and reviewing your final agreement to make sure it accurately reflects your goals and needs.  She maintains a close connection with select local mediators and mediation-friendly attorneys who routinely refer cases and clients to one another.       </p>

               In some cases, family tensions affect the implementation and success of even the best formulated parenting plans.  Jennifer often is appointed by parents or by judges to serve as a “parent coordinator” with clearly-defined authorities about her role.  As disputes arise regarding the ongoing best interests of your children, for example time with one or both parents, compliance with mental health or substance abuse treatment, or introduction of your children to new significant others, Jennifer will provide a safe, respectful forum to discuss these disputes without the emotional and financial cost of protracted litigation.  Depending upon the language in her appointment, she may meet with you and your children’s other parent separately or together along with your children.  She also may talk with professional collaterals who have useful information about your family dynamic.  With this background, Jennifer first helps you reach compromises through agreement then sets forth recommendations which may be implemented without the necessity of a formal court hearing.  The Probate and Family Court ultimately retains the authority to accept or modify these recommendations should one parent disagree with the scope or terms of your parent coordinator’s recommendations.  Use of a parent coordinator is a popular and promising way to manage the evolving needs of parents and children in a creative and open environment.              </p>

            <p>For cases involving children who have unmarried parents or who are living with other family members (like grandparents or guardians), Jennifer helps her clients to craft parenting plans for the best interests of each child and to use financial resources for the greatest common good of each family. Following the entry of any judgments by the Probate and Family Court, Jennifer also assists her clients with the necessary enforcement or defense of court obligations through Complaints for Contempt, addressing important issues such as access to one’s children or the collection or suspension of payments for alimony, child support, college expenses, or health-related costs. Often, Jennifer’s representation of her clients is required when one’s life situation changes, prompting the need to review an existing parenting plan or to adjust or terminate established financial obligations through the pursuit of a Complaint for Modification. She is highly trained in circumstances affected by domestic violence, mental health issues, and substance abuse, notably advocating for clients in the pursuit or defense of Abuse Prevention Orders before both civil and criminal courts.</p>
