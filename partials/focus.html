    <p class="team-info">Divorces encompass much of Jennifer’s practice, including the negotiation of complex and detailed parenting plans, support structures and property division. Jennifer also brainstorms with her clients to explore alternatives to divorce, including cases brought as “separate support” matters or situations benefitting from a post-marital or other agreement clarifying rights and responsibilities while people remain legally married. Given our twenty five years of professional experience in this unique practice niche, we advise our clients on different possible outcomes based upon case law, substantive law, procedural rules and trends by our local judges. Armed with this information, our clients are able to contemplate their decisions in a careful way to shape proactive and smart solutions well-suited for their families.

    <h1 class="focus-titles">Our Clients</h1>
    <p class="team-info">For the past twenty five years, Jennifer has helped families of all socioeconomic levels through emotionally and financially grueling legal circumstances. Often, her representative clients are W-2 employees with readily-valued assets such as marital homes, investment or retirement accounts, and a wide range of personal property. In her work, Jennifer also has handled cases involving compensation for and valuation of dental, law and medical practices; garden centers; retail businesses; restaurants; closely-held family corporations; franchises; supermarkets; real estate development companies; real estate sales offices; insurance agencies; and commercial and residential rental operations. She has been involved in matters affecting chief executive, financial and operating officers with complex compensation packages; military personnel; municipal employees for local communities as well as federal or state government; entrepreneurs and start-up companies; and court staff. Jennifer’s other clients include disabled individuals, elderly spouses, homemakers, and stay-at- home parents who may face unique challenges triggered by divorce. In addition, she helps families impacted by addiction, domestic violence, mental health and substance abuse issues not only as individuals but also as parents. A case may warrant the close involvement of educational advocates, medical teams, psychologists, and therapists to provide the most holistic resolution. </p>
